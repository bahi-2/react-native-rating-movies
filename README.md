# react-native-rating-movies
Mobile application for a local Croatian cinema, which displays movies currently playing along with their IMDB ratings.

*NOTE: This is still a work in progress, but after I'm satisfied with the work I've made I plan on writting up a simple tutorial for people interasted in learning from my code.*

## Get Started

1. Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/bahi-2/react-native-rating-movies
